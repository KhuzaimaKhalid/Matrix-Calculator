# üßÆ Matrix Calculator

This is a simple **Matrix Calculator** written in Java, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as abstract classes, inheritance, method overriding, dynamic class selection, and user input handling via `Scanner`.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Supports **three data types**: Integer, Float, and Double matrices
- **Dynamic selection** of matrix type at runtime
- **Matrix operations**:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Element-wise Multiplication
  - Combined operations (e.g., Addition & Multiplication)
- **Custom matrix size**: user can specify number of rows and columns
- **Interactive menu system** for operation selection
- **Input validation** and interactive prompts

## üß± Class Structure

### `matrix` (Abstract Class)
- Fields:
  - `row`, `col` (matrix dimensions)
  - `Scanner sc` (for user input)
- Abstract Methods:
  - `init()`: Initialize matrix size and allocate arrays
  - `input()`: Take matrix values from user
  - `add()`: Matrix addition
  - `sub()`: Matrix subtraction
  - `mul()`: Element-wise multiplication
  - `printm()`: Print matrices and results
  - `close()`: Close resources

### `int_matrix`, `float_matrix`, `double_matrix` (Concrete Classes)
- Inherit from `matrix`
- Implement all abstract methods for respective data types
- Fields:
  - Two input matrices (`mat1`, `mat2`)
  - Three result matrices (`resa`, `resb`, `resc`) for addition, subtraction, and multiplication

### `Matrix_Calculator` (Main Class)
- Presents a menu to:
  - Select matrix type (Integer/Float/Double)
  - Enter matrix dimensions and elements
  - Choose desired matrix operations
  - Display results
  - Repeat or exit

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User selects the **data type** (Integer, Float, Double) for matrices.
2. User enters the **matrix size** (rows and columns).
3. User **inputs elements** for two matrices.
4. User chooses one or more **operations** (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or combinations).
5. The calculator **performs the operations** and displays all matrices.
6. User can perform more calculations or exit.
